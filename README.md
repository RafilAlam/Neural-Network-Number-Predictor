# 🧠 Neural-Network-Number-Predictor  

🎯 **Number Prediction Model from scratch**  
> A simple yet smart number guessing model powered by a trained static neural network that tries it's best to predict what number you type — blending fun with machine learning.
> Being made from scratch, it has allowed me to better grasp the fundamentals of Neural Networks and training algorithms.
